quagmire.pl (the master program) is made up of three PanedWindows and a status bar:

 /-------------\
 | A |         | A: the Encounter tracking Frame
 |   | B       | B: the Initiative List tracking HList
 -   +---------|
 |   | C       | C: the current Entity editor
 |   |         |
 \===status====/ the status bar

The Encounter tracking frame allows the user to use buttons to:
(TODO) Advance inititive order to the next entity in the list, kicking off the "round actions" for the entity
(DONE) Save/Load the current encounter, so that the status may be restored after an interrupted session
(TODO) Reset the encounter (round 0, option to fully heal/reset monsters and players, etc)

The Initiative List shows a "table" with the following information, per entity:
initiative count, initiative bonus, mob/player, level, class, ac, fort, ref, will, hp_current/hp_total, hp_temp, name
The initiative list is sorted on initiative order, but dead entities are always displayed last on the list.
The entities are colour-coded depending on whether their HP indicate they're >bloodied, dead<X<=bloodied, or dead.

Right clicking on the Initiative List allows the user to:
- if right clicking anywhere:
  - Refresh the Initiative list contents (DONE: label "Refresh")
  - Commit the changes done to an Entity and refresh the list (DONE: label "Commit & Refresh")
- if right clicking only anywhere an entity isn't displayed:
  - Add new Player (DONE: adds it to the list, allows double clicking to edit it via the Entity editor)
  - Add new Monster (DONE: adds it to the list, allows double clicking to edit it via the Entity editor)
