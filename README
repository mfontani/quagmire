QUAGMIRE

From http://en.wiktionary.org/wiki/quagmire:
Quagmire /"kwQg.maI@(r)/
  2. (figuratively) A mixed up and troubled situation; a hopeless tangle; a predicament. 

OVERVIEW

This perl/Tk/Moose program should aid D&D 4th Edition Dungeon Masters to better handle the
quagmire that is D&D 4th Edition encounters between player characters and monsters.

GOALS

You should be able to create a party of characters and a party of monsters, assign them
statistics and powers, save them on a MooseX::Storage YAML file or load them up, and then
start the encounter itself.

Most of the chores of encounter tracking should be alleviated by using this tool. Choices
should always be overridable by the user: the program won't just roll dices: it will give
the user the ability to either roll dices and insert the value, accept the default value
presented, or decline the action altogether.

Depending on the user's choice, the initiative for the monsters and players may be
calculated by the program, or inputed; Attack rolls and damages, ongoing damage, ongoing
healing, and similar effects should also receive the same treatment. Conditions and states
may be added to or removed from entities anytime during the encounter.

HISTORY

Tracking the multitude of hit points, damage types, resistances, powers and effects using
graph paper only may soon overwhelm and become too much of a chore for the Dungeon Master.

This collection of modules started with the aim of providing a quick way to print out a
PDF "encounter sheet" for every encounter in an adventure, showing all player characters
and monsters, their defenses, hit points, xp value and similar basic statistics.

Another PDF was created, to cut out "initiative count cards", showing instead all the
specific abilities, skills, and powers of all entities in the encounter, to be then
physically sorted on initiative order and be used as aide.

Currently, the program contains data sets and classes that should be able to do all the
above and beyond. The current focus is though more on the Tk GUI and its usability.

PERL MODULES NEEDED

See META.yaml. If you're missing them, you should be able to install them using:

$ sudo cpan .

Alternatively, look at the list on META.yaml or run something like:

$ ack -h --perl '^(use|require\W)' | sort | uniq
